PDL::OpenCV - PDL interface to OpenCV

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use PDL::OpenCV::Videoio; # ucfirsted name of the OpenCV "module"
  my $vfile='t/Megamind.avi';
  my $vc = PDL::OpenCV::VideoCapture->new; # name of the OpenCV class
  die "Failed to open $vfile" if !$vc->open($vfile);
  my ($frame, $res) = $vc->read;
  die "Failed to read" if !$res;
  my $writer = PDL::OpenCV::VideoWriter->new;
  # note 4th arg is an OpenCV "Size" - PDL upgrades array-ref to ndarray
  $writer->open($outfile, fourcc('M','P','4','V'), 20, [map $frame->dim($_), 1,2], 1);
  while ($res) {
    $writer->write($frame);
    # and/or display it, or feed it to a Tracker, or...
    ($frame, $res) = $vc->read;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use PDL::OpenCV to call OpenCV functions on your data using Perl/PDL.

As can be seen above, this distribution is structured to very closely
match the structure of OpenCV v4 itself. That means the submodules
match the "classes" and/or "modules" in OpenCV, with the obvious exception
of the C<Mat> class which needs special handling to thinly wrap ndarrays
going into and coming back from OpenCV.

This includes method/function names which are exactly the same
as in OpenCV, without being modified for the common Perl idiom
of snake_casing. This is intended to make the OpenCV documentation
trivially easy to use for the PDL binding (where a binding exists),
including available tutorials.

The API is generated from the Python bindings that are part of OpenCV. In
imitation of that, you are not currently able, as with "normal" PDL
functions, to pass in output ndarrays.

Where things do not work as you would expect from a PDL and/or OpenCV
point of view, and it is not documented as doing so, this is a bug -
please report it as shown at L</BUGS> below.

=head1 IMAGE FORMATS

In PDL, images are often C<byte,3,x,y> or occasionally (e.g. in
L<PDL::Graphics::Simple>) C<byte,x,y,3>. The 3 is always R,G,B. Sometimes
4 is supported, in which case the 4th column will be an alpha
(transparency) channel, or 1, which means the image is grayscale.

OpenCV has the concepts of "depth" and "channels".

"Depth" is bit-depth (and data type) per pixel and per channel: the
bit-depth will be a multiple of 8, and the data type will be integer
(signed or unsigned) or floating-point.

"Channels" resembles the above 1/3/4 point, with the important caveat
that the default for OpenCV image-reading is to format data not as R,G,B,
but B,G,R. This is for historical reasons, being the format returned by
the cameras first used at the start of OpenCV. Use C<cvtColor> if your
application requires otherwise.

PDL data for use with OpenCV must be dimensioned C<(channels,x,y)>
where C<channels> might be 1 if grayscale. This module will not use
heuristics to guess what you meant if you only supply 2-dimensional data.

Be careful when scaling byte-valued inputs to maximise dynamic range:

  $frame = ($frame * (255/$max))->byte; # works
  $frame = ($frame * 255/$max)->byte;   # multiply happens first and overflows

=head1 OPENCV MINOR DATA-TYPES

In OpenCV, as well as the most important type (C<Mat>), there are various
helper types including C<Rect>, C<Size>, and C<Scalar> (often used for
specifying colours). This distribution wraps these as ndarrays of
appropriate types and dimensions.

While in C++ there are often default values for the constructors
and/or polymorphic ways to call them with fewer than the full number
of arguments, this is currently not possible in PDL. Therefore, e.g. with
a C<Scalar>, you have to supply all four values (just give zeroes for
the ones that don't matter, e.g. the alpha value for a colour on a
non-alpha image).
