['FileNode',[],'@brief File Storage Node class.

The node is used to store each and every element of the file storage opened for reading. When
XML/YAML file is read, it is first parsed and stored in the memory as a hierarchical collection of
nodes. Each node can be a "leaf" that is contain a single number or a string, or be a collection of
other nodes. There can be named collections (mappings) where each element has a name and it is
accessed by a name, and ordered collections (sequences) where elements do not have names but rather
accessed by index. Type of the file node can be determined using FileNode::type method.

Note that file nodes are only used for navigating file storages opened for reading. When a file
storage is opened for writing, no data is stored in memory after it is written.'],
