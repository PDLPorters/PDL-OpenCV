This is an attempt to interface OpenCV from PDL. It is centred around object
tracking, at the moment. Full coverage of OpenCV features is beyond my
resources, at the moment.

This is in early development, it is not working as intended yet.

In the tw directory, the sources for the wrapper are contained. They can be
built using cmake. If you know a simple recipe to call it from the top level,
please let me know. To me, that is low priority.

Currently this is compiled for OpenCV 4.5. At least between majer versions, the
API is changing. Some support for v3.2 is likely to come in the future.
