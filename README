PDL::OpenCV

This is an attempt to interface OpenCV from perl and PDL.
There is a C abstraction layer
because of conflicts between perl and OpenCV (C++) headers.

The idiom used is that OpenCV Mat objects are created only to be used
to wrap PDL ndarrays' data, which simplifies object lifecycle management.

Currently this is compiled for OpenCV 4.2 and 4.5. At least between major versions, the
API is changing. Some support for v3.2 is likely to come in the future. See the INSTALL 
file for instructions!

OpenCV has a multitude of functions and classes. Full coverage of OpenCV
features is beyond my knowledge and resources. If you want to extend PDL::OpenCV, feel free
to do so.
See the Tracker class for creating a persistent OpenCV entity.

Many functions are fairly simple to wrap, e.g. rows, cols, so code can be
generated by PP using ufunc (copied and simplified from ops.pd). Also, wrapper code can be generated,
see cw/Makefile.PL for how this is done. I would suggest that you put extensions into their own modules
within the PDL::OpenCV namespace reflecting the OpenCV class/namespace. Please share your extensions!
