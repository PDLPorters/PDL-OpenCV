This requires ExtUtils::MakeMaker and cmake, besides PDL and OpenCV v4. 

It is tested on Debian/Linux with a recent gcc. 

The module consists of two parts. A C/C++ wrapper of OpenCV and the perl/PDL
interface. Therefore, the installation needs two steps. To install, 

	cd cw
	perl MakeFIle.PL
	cd build
	sudo make install

This has installed the OpenCV C wrapper layer. To get the perl bindings, go back

	cd ..
	cd ..
	perl MakeFile.PL 
	make test
	sudo make install

and install the PDL::OpenCV module.
