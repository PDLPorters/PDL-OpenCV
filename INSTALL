This requires ExtUtils::MakeMaker and cmake, besides PDL and OpenCV v4.2+

It is tested on Debian/Linux with a recent gcc. 

The module consists of two parts. A C/C++ wrapper of OpenCV and the perl/PDL
interface. Therefore, the installation needs two steps.

	cd cw
	perl MakeFIle.PL

This has built the OpenCV C wrapper layer. To build the perl bindings, go back

	cd ..
	perl MakeFile.PL 
	make test

To install the PDL::OpenCV module:

	sudo make install
